# GDG-project-HM-FinVision
This project involves webscrapping of financial data and creating a dataframe using libraries such as numpy,pandas etc

The given data is not completely present in the single website . Half of the content is i screener and the other half is in NSE.

So Basically we should scrap the data and merge finally . For screener we can statically use requests+beautifulSoup library but for 
NSE website we should use selenium+beautiful soup to extract data 

Finally I merged both the data frames
